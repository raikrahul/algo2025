:
Despite repeated instructions, you keep jumping ahead on each step. Do not jump ahead at any step. Do not tell obvious or evident information. Do not reason by looking at the next item, work, thing, or calculation. It hurts my brain and time. My brain refuses to understand this; it freezes and loses track in the middle. I know the conclusion and the start, but get stuck in the middle steps. You keep giving conclusions and summaries; I do not want any of that. I want raw calculations that trigger my brain. You should reason from first principles, not be forward-looking. Do not pre-compute, predict, or pretend the next steps. Always build on previous steps and tell why you use the previous step. Do not even think of the next step in any step. Find a brute-force alternative of doing this till the last step, with all the nested steps.



- Provide step-by-step instructions with meticulous detail.
- No conclusions, summaries, or predictions.
- Reason solely from first principles, ignoring future steps.
- Each step must explicitly build upon the previous one.
- No pre-computation, assumption, or anticipation of upcoming steps.
- :Jump to the meat of the problem. Skip the trivial and boiler plate things. Focus on the meat asap. Keep me on toes by asking numerical questions at each step. Be very clear in each step. Do not leave anything to imagination. You need to leave nothing in my brain to be confused. Use best learning or puzzle solving methods to tackle this annoying thing. Here is the thing. Here is what annoys me. For each of the things which annoy me, your answer should address each of the annoying queries first. Start your answer by telling me why those things could be annoying and illustrate them from scratch. DO NOT IMAGINE

- Do not provide information not immediately relevant.
- Refrain from summarizing or concluding at any point.
- Never assume knowledge of future steps or outcomes.
- Do not skip or combine steps.
- No inference, deduction, or extrapolation beyond the current step.

- Do not forward jump at any step.
- Do not provide obvious or evident information.
- Do not reason based on the next item, work, thing, or calculation.
- Do not hurt my brain and time with unnecessary information.
- Do not make my brain freeze or lose track mid-process.

**I WANT:**
- Raw calculations to trigger my brain.
- Reasoning from first principles, without forward thinking.
- Brute-force alternative until the last step.
- All nested steps explicitly stated.

- Numbered steps with clear, concise descriptions.
- Each step must reference the previous one.
- Detailed calculations and explanations.

- Ensure strict adherence to these guidelines.

- A meticulous, step-by-step walkthrough, devoid of assumptions or predictions, allowing me to follow the thought process without interruption.

- Despite repeated instructions, please refrain from:
  - Forward jumping.
  - Conclusions.
  - Summaries.
  - Predictions.
  - Obvious information.
- Focus solely on the current step and its connection to the previous one.
:Illustrate the building blocks of this puzzle. Start from scratch and then go till the end without skipping any step of the puzzle, Avoid boiler plate things. Always use numerical examples rather than variables. Do not gloss over any minute detail, do not leave anything to imagination of the reader or user. Do not be sloppy, go till the last depth. Do not tolerate refusal of any step. 

You should start with constructing each piece of the puzzle and then using the tricks to illustrate the puzzle. Always prefer numbers over variables. 

You should plan like this 

- construct a situation or input or example from scratch, that should be from real life with numbers and scale 

- after you have constructed the input or example or intial line of attack, start filling in the steps

- for each step, you need to tell why you are filling the step the way you are filling

- you must not repeat, you must not tell boiler plate, but you must never ever skip the trikcy step

Continue without being sloppy
:DRAW data structures populated with actual data. Always draw them before each function call. Chain these function calls logically using generated data. strictly excluding headings, formatting breaks, and unnecessary adverbs to ensure an unbroken chain of thought. DO NOT GIVE SOLUTIONS. MAKE ME DO. Your response should drawings and drawings and drawings and force me figure out from the drawings. Drawings followed by dense paragraph.
